Sales Data


Aim
To create a comprehensive data warehousing solution capable of effectively managing and processing sample sales data that facilitates seamless reporting and analysis.


Objectives
1. Data Warehouse Design
2. Script Development for Table Derivation 
3. Power BI Dashboard Creation


Introduction to the dataset
The raw dataset consists of 25 columns, encompassing essential information. In total, there are 2823 entries. The dataset showcases 18 distinct orderline numbers and 6 distinct status categories. Among 2823 orders, 2617 were successfully Shipped. The sales data spans the years 2003 to 2005, covering 7 distinct product lines distributed across 19 countries. Deal sizes are categorized as Medium, Small, and Large. Noteworthy, the maximum Quantity Ordered was for product S12_4675, while the minimum was for S18_2325. The highest sales were attributed to product S18_1749, achieving $14082.8, with the lowest recorded for S32_2509 at $482.13. Furthermore, the dataset comprises 92 unique customers and 109 distinct product IDs. 


Data warehouse architecture
1.Data Sources
This architecture can ingest data from various sources, including CSV and JSON files, raw data feeds, and cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This flexibility allows you to integrate data from a wide range of sources.

2.Data Processing and Storage
This design use Snowflake as the core data warehouse platform. Snowflake provides a multi-stage approach.
Staging - Raw data is initially landed in Snowflake's temporary storage for processing.
Conformed Dimensions - Standardized reference data tables are created to ensure consistency across the warehouse.
Aggregated Data - Pre-calculated summaries of detailed data are stored in Snowflake views for faster querying.

3.Services
This layer focuses on data consumption and analysis.:
Dashboards - Interactive dashboards for visualizing key metrics and trends.
Reporting - Tools for generating detailed reports based on data warehouse queries.
Analysis - Capabilities for advanced data analysis and exploration.
Power BI - Integration with Power BI for further data manipulation and visualization.

4.Governance and Operations
This layer ensures the smooth operation and security of the data warehouse. 
Resource Monitor - Tracks and controls resource usage within Snowflake.
Error Logs - Captures and logs errors into a separate table for troubleshooting purposes.
User Roles - Defines access permissions for different user groups within the data warehouse.


Data Modelling
The approach to modeling the data using a SQL script

1.Schema and database creation
Created a warehouse named "VEHICLE_DEALER" and a database named "SALES_DB".
Created a schema named "YEAR_03_04_05" to organize the tables for data on the years 2003, 2004, and 2005.

2.Loading data as RAW
Created a table named "RAW_DATA" within the "YEAR_03_04_05" schema to store the raw sales data.
Created a file format to facilitate loading data from CSV files into the "RAW_DATA" table.
Checked for missing values and logged errors.
Detected and logged duplicate records 

3.Dimensional table creation
DIM_CUSTOMERS for customer details.
DIM_PRODUCTS for product details.
DIM_DATE for date-related information.

4.Fact table creation
Created a fact table named "FACT_SALES" to store sales transactions.
Established foreign key relationships with dimensional tables to maintain data integrity.
Clustered the table by the year of the transaction date to optimize query performance.

5.View creation for easy data analysis
Summary of total sales, orders, and customers - VW_SALES_SUMMARY
Sales breakdown by product - VW_SALES_BY_PRODUCT
Sales breakdown by customer - VW_SALES_BY_CUSTOMER
Potential sales analysis using MSRP and price each - VW_POTENTIAL_SALES_USING_MSRP
Quarterly sales analysis by region - VW_QUARTERLY_SALES_BY_REGION
Quarterly sales revenue analysis - VW_QUARTERLY_SALES_REVENUE
Country performance analysis by year - VW_COUNTRY_PERFORMANCE_BY_YEAR
Sales analysis by status - VW_SALES_BY_STATUS

6.Data Validation Checks
Implemented data validation queries to identify duplicates in dimensional and fact tables, ensuring data integrity.

7.Resource monitor setup and ownership
Created a resource monitor with daily credit limits and trigger warnings to control the usage of credits
Ownership of tables is for only account admins and organization admins
Ownership of views is for sysadmins.


Entity relationship diagram 
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showcases the structure of the data warehouse designed for sales analysis. It consists of five tables: RAW_DATA (stores raw sales data), DIM_CUSTOMERS (unique customers), DIM_PRODUCTS (unique products), DIM_DATE (extracted dates), and FACT_SALES (integrated sales data). Dimension tables hold unique values, while the fact table has foreign keys connecting them, allowing for comprehensive sales analysis based on customers, products, dates, and other sales details.
